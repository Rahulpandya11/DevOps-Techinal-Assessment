Why I didn’t go 100% with Spot instances: I have seen this in several clients (and at my current job)
Spot instances can disappear when load spikes. That causes user-facing problems when instances get reclaimed, so as a safe approach I keep at least one On-Demand instance running
That way if a region has issues or Spot capacity drops, the service still stays up
I could also be have used schedule sacaling with current vertical Scaling but not mentioned so didn't used 

I used one ALB for all services. Creating multiple ALBs adds cost and extra management overhead. I have done both ways with customers and using one ALB works fine and is easier to handle for this setup.

I Used Secrets Manager instead of SSM (assessment specified SSM)

Reasoning:
-Better secret lifecycle (automatic rotation, versioning)
-Native ECS integration via task execution role
-Per-service isolation (each service has its own vault)
-Built-in encryption and audit logging

Slightly higher cost (~$0.40/secret/month) but more security. which is why i used and i have experience with working on 

I have created Architecture diagram in draw.io and added in repo for better understanding the flow

There were few more things and many different approches that i could have used but currently as of timelimit i am doing accoring to what i could do fast and make assessment prod ready ASAP

There was also one approch of creating workflow for deploying new service automaticly using github action (current not added but i have created same in current and previous org) and it's very faster and non error way to make so

Currently not configure rout53 health check monitors or any SNS topic to alert in thirdparty tool because third-party tooling not set up

And lastly for doc creation and few errors that i encounterd i used OpenAI to make it clean apart from that i have created similar Architecture in terraform with ECS and fargate so i know things how it work so i made that by myself accoring to what i have faced issue and best practice when i crated in current and past org
